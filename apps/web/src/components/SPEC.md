## Responsibility

The app's single **error-boundary primitive** — the one thing that keeps a panel's render crash or a
failed lazy chunk from unmounting the React root — plus the **`CustomIcon`** primitive for the few
project-custom glyphs Remix lacks and the shared **loading-skeleton primitive**. Also houses the `ui/`
sub-module (shadcn primitives), which has its own spec.

## Boundary

- **Owns:** `ErrorBoundary.tsx` — a class boundary (`getDerivedStateFromError`) that renders a themed,
  self-contained fallback instead of propagating a throw to the root. It:
  - resets a caught error when any `resetKeys` value changes (wire to the subtree's identity —
    workspace/tab id — so navigating away auto-recovers);
  - classifies failed dynamic `import()`s via the pure, unit-tested **`isChunkLoadError`** (stale Vite
    chunk / 504 / Safari "module script failed") and steers those to a page **reload** (re-fetches the
    chunk) rather than an in-place retry;
  - logs the crash to the console (`componentDidCatch`) — the UI already degrades gracefully.
- **`CustomIcon.tsx`** — renders an SVG from `public/custom-icons/` as a themeable `currentColor` glyph
  via a CSS `mask-image` span (`.custom-icon*` classes in `index.css`), so a custom glyph sizes with
  `size-*` and colours with `text-*` exactly like a Remix icon. Names are a typed union
  (`CustomIconName`); today: `file-diff-line`/`file-diff-fill` (the Changes tool glyph).
- **Also owns:** `Skeleton.tsx` — `SkeletonRows`, the one pulsing-rows placeholder every loading surface
  uses. The full loading vocabulary and its rules are below.
- **Public surface:** `ErrorBoundary`, `isChunkLoadError`, `SkeletonRows` — imported directly via
  `@/components/ErrorBoundary` / `@/components/Skeleton` (no barrel); `CustomIcon`, `CustomIconName` via
  `@/components/CustomIcon`. The `ui/` primitives are their own sub-module
  ([components/ui/SPEC.md](ui/SPEC.md)).
- **Allowed deps:** React, `@remixicon/react`, `lib` (`shallowEqualArrays` — the reset-keys comparison, shared
  rather than re-stated). Kept dependency-light on purpose, and `lib` is a leaf, so *any* region (shell,
  panels, `main.tsx`) can still wrap in it without creating a cycle.
- **Forbidden:** `store`/`transport`/`panels`/`shell`/`chat`/`contracts`; `server`/`shared`/`pi`; inline
  `style` objects or raw hex (fallback is themed with token utilities only).

## Loading vocabulary

The app's loading vocabulary is exactly **two-tier** — every async gap renders one of these two, never a
third thing, never bare text, never nothing:

1. **`SkeletonRows` — for a *content region***: any area that will fill with substantial content, however
   that region is framed (a tool panel, a dialog's list, a menu's list section, a tab body, a `Suspense`
   fallback restoring a chat/plan/editor, the shell's full workbench restore). **Surface size decides the
   tier, not the container type** — a spinner centred in a large empty region reads as a heavier, more
   alarming kind of wait than the content-shaped skeleton used one panel over for the identical "data is on
   the way" situation, so a region is never spinner-only regardless of what widget it lives inside (a
   dialog, a dropdown, a workbench tab). Reference sites: `panels/FileTree.tsx`, `panels/SpecsPanel.tsx`,
   `panels/ChangesPanel.tsx`, `panels/ReviewPanel.tsx`, `panels/PlanPane.tsx`, `panels/ProjectTree.tsx`
   (worktree list), `panels/ExistingWorktreeDialog.tsx` (worktree-candidate list),
   `panels/ChangesScopeMenu.tsx` (commit list), `panels/WelcomePanel.tsx`'s `CardSkeleton` (a hand-shaped
   variant sized to the cards it stands in for, since a generic row list would misrepresent a card grid's
   footprint), `shell/WorkbenchSkeleton.tsx` (composed from the same primitive per side/centre column,
   never bare status text), and `shell/WorkspaceWorkbench.tsx`'s `MissingResource` (every chat/plan/editor
   tab-body and lazy-chunk `Suspense` fallback).
2. **`Loader2` spinner (usually beside a short label) — for an *in-flight action or transient state* pinned
   to its control**: a single button, one menu item, one icon — never a whole region. Reference sites:
   the "New chat"/"Creating…" button states, `shell/WorkspaceChatHistory.tsx`'s history icon,
   `chat/ActivityGroup.tsx`/`chat/ToolCard.tsx` step icons, `panels/ProjectTree.tsx`'s "Creating worktree…"
   pending row. A narrower named sub-idiom of this tier: **`RefreshCw` spinning in place** (icon unchanged,
   just rotating) for a manual "Refresh" action on a control whose surrounding content stays visible and
   valid while the refresh runs (`chat/ModelSelector.tsx`, `panels/GithubSettings.tsx`,
   `panels/ProvidersSettings.tsx`, `panels/BranchPicker.tsx`) — swapping to a generic spinner there would
   discard the "this still works, just refreshing" signal the in-place spin gives for free.

Beyond picking the right tier:

- **No layout jump.** A loading state occupies the same footprint the arriving content will — a skeleton
  sized/shaped for its region, a `CardSkeleton` sized like the card it precedes — so the data replacing it
  never shifts anything around it.
- **A retry/error affordance is never paired with an active loading indicator.** Showing "Retry" next to a
  spinner or skeleton sends two contradictory signals at once ("this is normal, wait" and "this already
  failed, act") for what is, in the overwhelming majority of cases, still-normal loading. Two legitimate
  shapes: (a) the retry button appears **only after a real failure** — a rejected request lands in a
  `catch`, e.g. `panels/ChangesPanel.tsx`'s `changes-retry`, `panels/ExistingWorktreeDialog.tsx`'s
  `existing-worktree-retry`; or (b) for a resource an *automatic* background process is already racing to
  restore (chat-session hydration via `shell/chatReconciliation`), the loading indicator shows alone and a
  retry affordance surfaces only once that automatic attempt has stayed stalled past a short grace window —
  `shell/WorkspaceWorkbench.tsx`'s `ChatResourcePending`/`CHAT_RETRY_DELAY_MS` is the reference
  implementation; reach for the same shape before inventing a new one.
- **Conditionally-absent content is not a loading state.** When "still loading" and "definitely nothing
  here" render identically (both blank) *and* blank is the correct steady state — not merely an
  unhandled gap — showing nothing while unresolved is correct, not a defect: `chat/ChatPlan.tsx`'s
  `plan.data === null` guard is gated at its call site (`chat/ChatView.tsx` only mounts the plan
  strip/popover once `plan.data` exists at all), so there is no "empty region promising content" the way
  `panels/WelcomePanel.tsx`'s always-eventually-populated card row has. Reach for a skeleton only when the
  region is guaranteed to fill; reach for nothing only when it may legitimately never fill and the caller
  already treats absence as absence, not as a pending state.
- Bare "Loading…"/"Restoring…" text with neither a skeleton nor a spinner is a defect, full stop.
- **The resolved content fades in rather than popping in.** Once a skeleton's data arrives, the element that
  replaces it carries `motion-safe:animate-reveal` (`index.css`'s shared `reveal` keyframe — 150ms
  opacity+translateY, the same primitive `chat/tools/AskUserQuestionCard.tsx` already uses for a card
  settling into place; `motion-safe:` so `prefers-reduced-motion` gets an instant swap instead). It goes on
  the resolved branch's own root — never the skeleton, never a wrapper that also encloses the skeleton
  branch (a `Suspense` boundary's *children*, not the `Suspense` element itself) — because the animation
  plays once on that element's mount, and a shared wrapper around both branches would fire on first paint,
  before the data (or the resolved content itself) exists to fade in. It never re-fires on ordinary
  re-renders (a longer todo list, a new chat message) because React reconciles the same persistent DOM node
  across those — only the branch switch is a real mount. `panels/DiffPane.tsx`/`panels/FilePane.tsx` wrap
  `RenderedDiff`/`MarkdownPreview`'s lazy `Suspense` children in it — but pointedly **not** `MonacoDiff`/
  `MonacoEditor`'s: `@monaco-editor/react` shows its own second `loading={<SkeletonRows/>}` internally while
  Monaco's own runtime boots, *after* our `Suspense` chunk has already resolved, so wrapping our `Suspense`
  boundary there fades in — a still-loading skeleton, not the real editor, an animated flash into a second,
  unanimated skeleton swap that reads as two different loading indicators blinking rather than one. The
  correct fix for that stacked case would live inside `MonacoEditor`/`MonacoDiff`'s own `loading` render
  (an internal library-boot state we don't otherwise touch), not at the outer call site — left unanimated
  until that's worth doing. A terminal body (`TerminalWorkbenchBody`) skips the reveal too, since a
  terminal's PTY attach is gated on its own visibility mount and is not worth risking for a cosmetic fade,
  and a Radix menu's items skip it as well, since wrapping bare `DropdownMenuItem`s in a div breaks the
  primitive's direct-child keyboard/typeahead traversal (`panels/ChangesScopeMenu.tsx`'s commit list stays
  skeleton-then-pop for this reason). `chat/ChatView.tsx`
  skips it for a sharper reason: a non-`none` `transform` on an ancestor — including mid-animation, before
  the keyframe settles at `none` — establishes a new containing block, which broke the sticky positioning
  of `chat/activityBreadcrumbs.tsx`'s breadcrumb bar nested inside it (`e2e/activity-breadcrumbs.spec.ts`
  caught this in review). Anything with a `position: sticky`/`fixed` descendant is disqualified from this
  transform-based reveal outright, no exception list needed — check for one before adding it.

## Get right

- **Scope of protection:** React boundaries catch **render + lazy-import** throws only — **not** errors in
  event handlers, effects, or rejected promises (e.g. `transport.request`). Those surface through
  `transport`'s `errorText()` as an error turn/notice, not here. The shell's "panels can't blank the app"
  guarantee is about render/lazy-load; async failures are a separate path.
- Where the boundary is mounted (each region + the last-resort root wrap) is owned by `shell/SPEC.md` and
  the parent dependency graph in `apps/web/SPEC.md`, not repeated here.
